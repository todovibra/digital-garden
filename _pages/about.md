*This is an about page.*
<p>
I'm a life-long gardener, former farmer and agro-ecological educator converted now into a web3 buildooor. This digital garden will be a space for me to plant ideas and grow them over time. My main areas of interest are NFTs, decentralized social networks, and metaverse worlds.

<p>
As a developer ultimately my mission is to harness the potential of web3 to create experiences that enhance people's relationships to one another and to the natural world as well. If you'd like to collaborate then please reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/dev_gardener">twitter</a>
